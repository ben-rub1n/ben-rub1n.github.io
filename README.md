# readMe
This repository was built using Barry Clark's Jekyll Now repository template (https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) for Julia Flander's Fall 2021, Northeastern, Intro. to Digital Humanities graduate course. However, I do plan on using this site outside of class as a portfolio.

Published TEI texts were published to the site using a localized version of the TEI CETEIcean tool (https://github.com/TEIC/CETEIcean) for publishing XML in a browser. I'm told  "The localized version is modified so that it can work with students' own XML rather than with TEI.

The localized components are as follows:
* /js/CETEI_local.js: This is a copy of the CETEI.js file which has been be modified to process elements from non-TEI namespaces. 
* /xml/CETEIcean_mine.css: This is a copy of the CETEIcean.css file that can be used to create styles that work with the localized element names. 
* /xml/template.html: This is a version of the CETEIcean HTML template that points to the localized CSS and Javascript files."

What else do people put in readMes? I'll update later when that quetsion is clearer to me.
