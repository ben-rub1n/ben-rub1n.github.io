title: Blog Shmog

Blog is a bizarre word. Who blogs anymore? So early 2000s...some Carrie Bradshaw type-shit (it was a blog she wrote right?).
Anyways, this post is a test above all else. I envision that normally I would post about a project, something I deem worthy of this site. I've made online portfolios in the past, but do think this format will be ideal because it demonstrates a level of technical proficiency that I want to demonstrate to employers. 
To close, I'll list some ideas I have for future posts here:
-Final "Teaching Portfolio" from Neal Lerner's class along with case study assignment
-Article review and book review from Proseminar
-Mention of Pensive (link to most recent issue)
-Text Encoding project from Intro. to D.H.
-Resume
-Potentially the projects I completed in previous semesters; assuming I find them on my computer
-Multiple posts communicating the process of my D.H. project with Generate

P.S. My tone in these posts will be deliberate, transparent, and honest. I want it to be evident that this site is a constructed, mediated, representation of me and I think the best way to do that is to have my voice be as present as possible--I see this as disrupting the idea that these are merely pages on the web.
