Howdy!
If you haven't put it together yet, name's Ben Rubin.

Education-wise, I received a BA in English Literature from Northeastern University in 2020 and am on track to complete an MA in the same field from the same unviersity--but with a concentration in Digital Humanities--in 2022. 

Professionally, I've worked at biomedical companies as a technical writer. To elaborate, that's about a year's worth of experience working with Oracle's UI/UX team on software for clinical researchers and about a summer's worth of experience with Merck's prod-doc team rebranding user guides for various chemicals and laboratory tools. Lastly, there was a time, long ago, when I worked for a year at a medical malpratice law firm, MMMK, where I supported the attorneys and paralegals in whatever way possible and aided their effort to digitize old legal and medical documents.

Personally, I am one of the founding members of Pensive Journal, a literary arts journal published out of Northeastern's Center for Spirituality, Dialogue, and Service. We are on our third issue now, and focus on promoting the voices of traditionally unrepresented groups. Also, I stand as the Digital Archive Lead for Northeastern's product-development studio, Generate, where my team and I are building an information system to keep the entire organization's Google Drive cleaned up and accessible.

### More Information

When I am not "grinding" (god what a word), you can find me destressing through one of my hobbies, whether that's:
1. playing bass or piano (I am classically trained but desperately trying to learn improvisation)
2. rock climbing and/or hiking
3. working out at the gym/meditating
